A basic API for looking up dictionary definitions.

This is a quick and dirty version of this project; there are several things I'd like to change in the future, not least of which is the dictionary source I'm using (an 8-year-old JSONified version of Webster's that I found [here](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary)). For now it's fulfilling the purpose I needed (extremely basic "is this a word?" validation) for the majority of cases. Also, using an RDBMS for this is kinda silly since there's no RD in my DB. I can see this being a good use case for learning a KV store tool, which is likely a better fit.

In any case, I have lots of very good intentions of revisiting this and making some improvements eventually. ðŸ™‚
